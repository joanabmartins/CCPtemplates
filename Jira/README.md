<h2>Jira Connector Status - PR submited</h2>

This connector was relatively straightforward to create. There was already a CCP v1 connector in github and apparently worked fine, the azure function also worked fine, so we could just get inspired on it.

There is already a lot of content for this connector, but everything uses the parser, so we just had to include our new table in the parser. 

<h3>Testing considerations</h3>
Free trial is available. To generate logs you just need to create and delete random projects.
