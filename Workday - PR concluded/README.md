<h2>Workday status: PR commited to master</h2>

This connector is about to be published.

The logs from this connector go directly to ASimAuditEventLogs table. We didn't create a special table to Workday. 

<h3>Template</h3>

I included here the entire packaged solution. To find the raw template of the connector you can go to Data Connectors/Workday_ccp/azuredeploy_Workday_poller_connector.json

<h3>Documentation</h3>

Customer sent me the document Workday Integration.pdf that I included in this directory. I also subscribed to the Workday Community to check some things further. 

<h3>Testing Considerations</h3>

Microsoft has a Workday environment that we have been using for testing.
