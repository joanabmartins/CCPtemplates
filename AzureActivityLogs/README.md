I created this template, when I was just starting to study CCP. 

Azure activity logs are an easy source to get access to, so it was a nice way to start learning CCP without having to subscribe to trials, nor antyhing.

We just need to register a new application in Entra ID, create a new secret, and give it RBAC access to get the activity logs from the subscription.

I didn't really explore pagination for this API.
